# libraries
This repository has two scripts that make use of the numpy and pandas libraries. The `data_processor.py` script contains functions that use these two libraries to create a random matrix, get the file dimensions of a matrix, and write a matrix to a file. 
The `plotter.py` script uses numpy, pandas and matplotlib to create various plots using the iris data set.

## Installing
